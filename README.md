# Face-Recognition-System

This project is a face recognition system that identifies whether two uploaded images belong to the same person using deep learning embeddings.

Features
1. Detects faces in images using RetinaFace
2. Extracts facial embeddings with the FaceNet model
3. Compares embeddings to determine if images are of the same person
4. Draws bounding boxes and labels on detected faces
5. Prints “Same person” or “Different people” for quick verification
